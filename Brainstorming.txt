## RULES:

“Berlin Wall” must occur at some time during the program
i.e. “When did the Berlin Wall occur?”

CODE MUST BE WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE STEPH LIKES TO SHOUT

All numbers must be greater than 100 because Steph always puts in 110%

Mentioning Aesthetics causes the program to run faster than usual

Stephscript will not compile if John is mentioned anywhere

To create constants preface the variable name with “Ulgethora”, as she is not one to change her mind

Naming a variable after a school sport results in the program printing “GO BULLDOGS” to stdout

Errors are called Rants

Lists are called Crap (or TODOs)

Stephscript can only be run on a computer with less than 5gb of space remaining, and the computer is NOT running the latest version of it’s OS

The device must NOT be flat/level for Stephscript to run (If available)

Stephscript must be run from the Desktop, or else it deletes itself

Running a stephscript script randomly generates a sticker to put on your laptop (http://randombumpersticker.com/)
