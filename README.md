# StephScript
Stephscript is an esoteric programming language based off the sayings, jokes and quirks of a friend from Computer Science class.
Stephscript is based off of Python, it's aslo currently made with python. Go Python!!

## Installation
Download this repository and PLACE THE FILE ON THE COMPUTER'S DESKTOP

## Usage
Currently there is only a live parser, just run the python script 'stephparse.py' and feed in the code through stdin. Additionally, you can run it with the argument '-f filename' to use a file instead.

## Syntax
### Rules
- [~] “Berlin Wall” must occur at some time during the program
- [~] CODE MUST BE WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE STEPH LIKES TO SHOUT
- [ ] All numbers must be greater than 100 because Steph always puts in 110%
- [~] Mentioning Aesthetics causes the program to run faster than usual
- [~] Stephscript will not compile if John is mentioned anywhere
- [ ] To create constants preface the variable name with “Ulgethora”, as she is not one to change her mind
- [ ] Naming a variable after a school sport results in the program printing “GO BULLDOGS” to stdout
- [X] Errors are called Rants
- [~] Lists are called Crap (or TODOs)
- [~] Stephscript can only be run on a computer with less than 5gb of space remaining, and the computer is NOT running the latest version of it’s OS
- [ ] The device must NOT be flat/level for Stephscript to run (If available)
- [~] Stephscript must be run from the Desktop, or else it deletes itself
- [ ] Running a stephscript script randomly generates a sticker to put on your laptop (http://randombumpersticker.com/)
- [ ] Making an instance of a class opens a new window, each print statement opens a new window
- ~~[ ] Stephscript can’t loop because Steph always does it right the first name~~
- [ ] Opens a random tumblr page randomly
