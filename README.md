# StephScript
Stephscript is an esoteric programming language based off the sayings, jokes and quirks of a friend from Computer Science class.

## Installation
Download this repository and PLACE THE FILE ON THE COMPUTER'S DESKTOP

## Usage
run `python main.py my_file` in terminal to use

## Syntax
### Rules
- [X] “Berlin Wall” must occur as the last line of the program
- [/] CODE MUST BE WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE STEPH LIKES TO SHOUT
- [ ] All numbers must be greater than 100 because Steph always puts in 110%
- [ ] Mentioning Aesthetics causes the program to run faster than usual
- [X] Stephscript will not compile if John is mentioned anywhere
- [ ] To create constants preface the variable name with “Ulgethora”, as she is not one to change her mind
- [ ] Naming a variable after a school sport results in the program printing “GO BULLDOGS” to stdout
- [ ] Errors are called Rants
- [ ] Lists are called Crap (or TODOs)
- [X] Stephscript can only be run on a computer with less than 5gb of space remaining, and the computer is NOT running the latest version of it’s OS
- [ ] The device must NOT be flat/level for Stephscript to run (If available)
- [/] Stephscript must be run from the Desktop, or else it deletes itself
- [ ] Running a stephscript script randomly generates a sticker to put on your laptop (http://randombumpersticker.com/)
- [ ] Making an instance of a class opens a new window, each print statement opens a new window
- ~~[ ] Stephscript can’t loop because Steph always does it right the first name~~
- [ ] Opens a random tumblr page randomly
- [X] Variables can only be named after certain words, specifically food and names
- [ ] Each program must throw at least one rant (error) because Steph keeps fucking things up

### Grammar
~~Unless otherwise denoted, Stephscript has the same grammer as python.~~

StephScript grammer borrows heavily from TumpScript, for now. Over time it will slowly develop it's own style.

#### Control flow:
- Use `,` and `;` to treat compound statements as a single evaluation, similar to how `()` are used in other languages
- Use `:` and `!` to define the scope of loops and if statements, similar to how `{}` is used in Java
